This application uses openweathermap as the source. The task required to show forecast for the next 5 days but unfortunately it needs a subscription for it. 

However this app uses 5 day / 3 hour forecast endpoint that shows an hourly forecast instead.

To use the application, enter a city name and click Search. If a city cannot be found it will show a corresponding error message.
